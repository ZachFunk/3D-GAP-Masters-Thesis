Training data and checkpoint can be downloaded from this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15FfUzHY7XDJfVu2JDEsWGhfmHFnbrK3D?usp=drive_link


Once the dataset has been loaded, replace the data location in the installion cell with the corresponding path of the downloaded data. If you want to use one of the trained models, make sure the dataloader window is has either (16,128,128), (32,128,128), or  (64,128,128) depending on the checkpoint. Each checkpoint has the corresponding window on it. Additionally, change the models depth and filters in the model config cell to match the checkpoints.
